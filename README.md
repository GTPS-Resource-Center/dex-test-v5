# DexV4
not mine, its the dex explorer v4, but with some improvements
* dex v4,v3 were really badly made(almost 100 mb of ram usage lol)

## Features

* Faster Loading `thread loading`
* Indetectable `100% indetectable`
* Copy Path `copies the selected instance path`
* View Script `allows you to see the selected script source code`
* Copy Script Source `copies the selected script source`
* Require Module `shows the require(module) response`

## Aditional changes (raging shit)
* Removed Properties window close button
* Removed Dragging from all the windows
* Didn't used the same shit syntax highlight as dex v3 (script viewer)
